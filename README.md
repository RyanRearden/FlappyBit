## About The Project

This project was made for my Introduction to Computer Science class during the Fall of 2022. It was heavily inspired by 
<a href="https://flippybitandtheattackofthehexadecimalsfrombase16.com/ "> <br> Flippy Bit And The Attack Of The Hexadecimals From Base 16</a>

Objectives:
* Use keys a - k to convert type a binary value
* If the binary value matches one of the hexadecimals on the screen a laser will shoot up and destroy the hexadecimal
* If a hexadecimal gets all the way to the bottom of the screen you lose

The purpose of this game is to teach others how to quickly convert binary to hexadecimal. It is a fun comp sci party trick! :sparkler:
